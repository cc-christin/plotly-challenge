Build an interactive dashboard exploring [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/)

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Step 1 Plotly
* use d3 libray to read samples.json
* create horizontal bar chart with drop down mean to display top 10 OTUs found in that individual
* use samples_values as values for bar chart
* otu_ids as labels for bar chart
* otu_labels as hovertext for chart
* bubble chart to display each sample
* otu_ids for x values
* sample_values for y values
* sample_values as maarker size
* otu_ids for marker colors
* otu_labels ffor text values
## Bubble Chart
* display metadata for individual demographics
* display key-value pair for metadata json on page
## deployment 
deploy app to live server extention on vscode
